# Starter
1901, the second year of the wonderful 'New Age of the World' and Avisa Lazard was stuck in her room again.

"I don't see why I have to stay in here tonight!" Avisa groaned as she stared at her father. Stomping her foot like a youth much younger than the girl she was; the white haired girl was wearing a rather pretty dress. Well it was not exactly a high end dress nor was it particularly wealthy for her families stature.

But it was all she could find in the dusty closets that fit, one of her great grandmothers dresses left in this dusty attic room.

"We have told you before Avisa, you are to remain in your room and keep the door locked; you are to speak to no one nor are you to make a sound. One of the butlers will bring you food and drink when it is appropriate."

"And if I have to use the bathroom?" She asked and her mother just raised her nose and let out a deep breath.

"Be quiet girl, or your father will have to intervene." Closing the door and turning to the servant guarding the door, she instructed him not to let her out.

Heading downstairs of the vast Manor hours within [[Tousir (City)]], Mrs Lazard, wife to Lord Lazard had prepared this party for six months, a whole 300 days planning to make everything perfect and she was not going to have that mistake of a daughter ruin it.

There were families and prominents from all through the Imperium coming to this party and she would make sure it went off without a hitch. In fact she had been surprised when their neighbour, a new Lord, had turned up but this was as good as any to get to know her new neighbours so had given them several invitations for their family.
