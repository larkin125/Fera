The Eighteen hundreds was Marx's favourite time, he had been born in it after all. The art and the style of the era was something not seen since. Fine art, paintings and masterpieces were a shilling a dozen and they were all masterpieces.

Now it was all just mimicry of a bygone age, a shadow of the past. A reflection of the once was. A memory of a better place and time. The twenty first century was in its infancy and yet already he had grown bored of it; at least the twentieth century had some fun, wars raged out in Fera but there was the ever changing styles, the art-deco and the beautiful new-renascence. However modernism took over and it bored him and would have bored him to death if he was not already dead.

Marx Delkofer was well known in the world for his art, his niche style and his musings that followed the same vein as many of his own ancestors; some joked that the first Marx Delkofer had not really died and had continued to live on through the ages creating these master pieces.

Oh they were not wrong, but the Fa√ßade would continue and hide this fact. Genealogy lines showed the modern Marx's lineage to the original Marx Delkofer.

The Delkofer family was not rich by any estimation, the constant losses due to drugs, drink and various hobbies always meant the Delkofer family was on the brink of bankruptcy for almost two hundred years. The current Marx Delkofer was no exception; his studio was the single floor of a low rise building on the outskirts of Tousir's old-town district. The ancient buildings of long 15th, 16th and 17th century housing turned to the more modern take. The exterior of the building was an old cotton mill and had been converted into three floors of apartments and a single floor of shops. Marx owned the second floor and had took over it in its entirety. Several bedrooms, a kitchen, several bathrooms and various storage rooms for his painting and writing supplies. 

Some who came to see his gallery or his library often mentioned that it seemed smaller than it should, as if rooms were missing. He had a grand library, all the books from his families collections along with several hundred of his own, locked away in a vast glass cabinet along one wall.

One large space was the studio, a vast artists gallery where various pieces could be drawn, sketched or painted with several different seats, beds and sets for people to  be sat at.

Today, Marx had two men in his studio, one was bent over a perfect replica of an Ancient Umissian chariot, the broken head of a spear at his throat while the other male, a dark skinned Umissian gentleman held the tip and pushed his cock three inches into the other's ass. They remained perfectly still in their embrace, both wearing ancient armour of the Umissian desert tribes that showed way too much skin and not enough armour.

Marx stood behind his easel, staring at them for a long moment before adding some more paint to the brilliant work of art he was painting in oil.
